                        <h2 data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">Early Life</h2>
                        <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">William John Cunningham Jr.—March 13, 1929—was born into an Irish Catholic family in Boston, Massachusetts. The second eldest in a family of four, having two sisters and an older brother, he grew up in a strict religious household. Attending church every Sunday, his interest in fashion began as he said he “could never concentrate on Sunday church services because I'd be concentrating on women's&nbsp;hats."</p>
                        <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">After graduating from high school, he attended Harvard University on a scholarship for two months, where he dropped out in 1948 moving to New York City at the age of 19. After leaving a couple jobs, Cunningham decided he would work for himself making hats under the name “William J”. However, that didn’t last long either as he was drafted into the Korean War and stationed in France. It was there where he had his first exposure to French fashion.</p>
                        <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">Completing a tour in the U.S. Army, he returned to New York in 1953 and resumed his work as a milliner. In 1958, a New York Times critic wrote that he had "cornered the face-framing market with some of the most extraordinarily pretty cocktail hats ever imagined." Some of his clients in the 1950’s included Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, and future First Lady Jaqueline Bouvier. Closing his hat shop in 1962, he followed the encouragement of his clients and started writing—first for Women’s Wear Daily and then for the Chicago Tribune.</p>

                        <p data-scroll="centerHorizontal, toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">Cunningham contributed significantly to fashion journalism, introducing American audiences to Azzedine Alaïa and Jean&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;Gaultier. While working at <i>Women's Wear Daily</i> and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, he began taking candid photographs of fashion on the streets of New York. He was a self-taught photographer. He took one such photograph of Greta Garbo, though he later said he had not recognized her while photographing her nutria coat: "I thought: 'Look at the cut of that shoulder. It's so beautiful.' All I had noticed was the coat, and the shoulder." He then published a group of impromptu pictures in the <i>New York Times</i> in December 1978, which soon became the regular series <i>On the Street</i>. His editor at the New York Times, Arthur Gelb, called these photographs "A turning point for the Times, because it was the first time the paper had run pictures of well-known people without getting their permission." He nevertheless joked about his role at the&nbsp;paper:</p>
                            <blockquote data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">I'm just the fluff. I fill around the ads, if we have any.</blockquote>
                        <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">He pioneered the paper's coverage of the gay community, photographing a fundraising event in the Fire Island Pines in 1979 letting the perceptive reader interpret his photos without verbal clues. By the 1990s, he integrated AIDS benefits, pride parades, and Wigstock into his coverage.</p>
                        <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">He wrote fashion criticism and published photo essays in <i>Details</i>, in which he was the first to apply to word "deconstructionism" to fashion. Design Oscar de la Renta said: "More than anyone else in the city, he has the whole visual history of the lasy 40 or to years of New York. It's the total scope of fashion in the life of New York." He made a career taking unexpected photographs of everday people, socialites and fashion personalities, many of whom valued his company.</p>

                        <p data-scroll="centerHorizontal, toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">Cunningham's most notable columns in the Times, <i>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;Street</i> and <i>Evening Hours</i> ran in the paper from February&nbsp;26,&nbsp;1989 until shortly before his death in 2016. For On the Street, Cunningham photographed people and the passing scene in the streets of Manhattan, often at the corner Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, which the New York Times called Cunningham's "main perch". As he worked, his focus was on clothing as personal expression. He did not photograph people in the manner of paparazzi, preferring genuine personal style to celebrity. He once explained why he was not joining a group of photographers who swarmed around Catherine Deneuve: "But she isn't wearing anything interesting." Late in life he explained: "I am not fond of photographing women who borrow dresses. I prefer parties where women spend their own money and wear their own dresses&hellip;When you spend your own money, you make a different choice." Instead,&nbsp;wrote Hilton Als in The New Yorker, "He loved 'the kids,' he said, who wore their souls on sleeves he had never seen before, or in quite that way." He was uninterested in those who showcased clothing they had not chosen themselves, which they modeled on the red carpet at celebrity events. Most of his pictures, he said, were never published. His fashion philosophy was populist and democratic:</p>
                            <blockquote class="c-p" data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">
                            Fashion is as vital and as interesting today as ever. I know what people with a more formal attitude mean when they say they're horrified by what they see on the street. But fashion is doing its job. It's mirroring exactly&nbsp;our times.
                            </blockquote>

                        <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn1, .fromBottomOut1)">Cunningham died age 87 in New York City on June&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2016, after being hospitalized for a stroke. His death was widely reported in both the fashion and the general press. Following his death, the Bergdorf Goodman department store created a display in its window memorializing Cunningham. Thousands signed an online petition requesting that the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street in New York City be renamed "Bill Cunningham Corner". In 2009, it was the New York Landmarks Conservancy that made him a living landmark, the same year The New Yorker, in a profile, described his On the Street and Evening Hours columns as the city’s unofficial yearbook: “an exuberant, sometimes retroactively embarrassing chronicle of the way we looked.”</p>

                    <p>FACADES brings together 128 of the best architectural settings and fashions from a 200-year period. Within 
                    the confines of Manhattan were found Egyptian 
                    temples and Russian cathedrals. Beaux-Arts mansions 
                    and Gothis Revival churches. Art Deco office buildings, 
                    and High Victorian department stores. Bill Cunningham 
                    started out in 1969, finding antique clothes in 
                    New York's thrift shops, street fairs and auctions, with 
                    no idea how far back he could go (he made it to 1770). 
                    These wonderful costumes are worn by Editta Sherman, "the Duchess of Carnegie Hall," as she poses for the camera in virtually every corner of Manhattan. Cunningham and the Duchess do away with the strict decorum and posture of the periods (and of fashion photography past and present) and capture in photographs and text an intelligent blend of fashion and architectural history, a spirit of playful animation, and the elusive sense of the past.</p>

                    <p>“We all get dressed for Bill,” says Vogue editor Anna Wintour. The Bill in question is 80+ New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham. For decades, this Schwinn-riding cultural anthropologist has been obsessively and inventively chronicling fashion trends he spots emerging from Manhattan sidewalks and high society charity soirees for his beloved Style section columns On The Street and Evening Hours.</p>
                    <p>Cunningham’s enormous body of work is more reliable than any catwalk as an expression of time, place and individual flair. The range of people he snaps uptown fixtures like Wintour, Brooke Astor, Tom Wolfe and Annette de la Renta (who appear in the film out of their love for Bill), downtown eccentrics and everyone in between reveals a delirious and delicious romp through New York. But rarely has anyone embodied contradictions as happily and harmoniously as Bill, who lived a monk-like existence in the same Carnegie Hall studio at for fifty years, never eats in restaurants and gets around solely on bike number 29 (28 having been stolen).</p>
                    <p>Bill Cunningham New York is a delicate, funny and often poignant portrait of a dedicated artist whose only wealth is his own humanity and unassuming grace.
